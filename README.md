# winter-breakpoint
what i've been up to over winter break (dec 2025 - jan 2026)

## what i've been doing

01/01/2026 - happy new year!! solved Invert Binary Tree. good intuition for variable swapping + recursion. also completed codingbat String-1, String-2, List-1, List-2 exercises. officially done codingbat python!!

12/31/2025 - reattempted Climbing Stairs. if you're calling a function within itself, you need to use .self. will redo again in the future as i need to solidify the syntax

12/30/2025 - String-1 and Logic-2 on codingbat. make-bricks and make-chocolate are very fun.

12/29/2025 - finished coding interview overview section of DSA course. recorded a mock interview of myself attempting a leetcode problem. solved some of Logic-2 in CodingBat. re-solved Merge Two Sorted Lists, got it in 1/3 of the time it took me on 12/27. you don't need new variables to track where you are in each list; you can just use the existing list names directly because you don't need the original lists themselves for anything else later.

12/28/2025 - did CodingBat's Logic-1. squirrels smoking cigars is a funny image. ternary operators are really cool. for Leetcode, did Valid Anagram, Valid Palindrome, Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

12/27/2025 - focused on linked lists. attempted Merge Two Sorted Lists and Reverse Linked List. a key point of linked lists is that if you attach 1 node from a diff list, all the subsequent nodes of that list are also appended. for Reverse Linked List, think of this q as tacking nodes to front of list, rather than appending to end. reattempted Valid Parentheses. missed the edge case where there's extra closing brackets at the end after the stack is empty (being there's an error if you try to access stack[-1]). overall much better understanding. did CodingBat's Warmup-2 and Logic-1.

12/26/2025 - reattempted Valid Parentheses. needed quite a bit of help. learned about negative indexing, list operations (append, pop), and how to access elements of dictionaries ("for bracket in brackets" checks keys, for example). more on for-loops too. did CodingBat's Python Warmup-1 and Warmup-2 to practice basics. finished Big O section through DSA course on Udemy, a good review.

12/25/2025 - merry christmas!! started Big O section through DSA Udemy course

12/24/2025 - solved Contains Duplicate. really beautiful one-line solution that harnesses properties of sets vs lists. joined DSA Udemy course.

12/23/2025 - solved Missing Number. no trouble.

12/22/2025 - reattempted Valid Palindrome again, did the double while loop, most eff sol.

12/21/2025 - re-solved Two Sum. reattempted Valid Palindrome, learned more regex syntax.
